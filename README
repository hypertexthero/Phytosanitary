Hacking django-coltrane to create a generic resources website CMS for my place of work.

Todo
---

1. Rename 'coltrane' to 'phytosanitary'
2. Rename 'entry' to 'resource'
3. User Registration (done?)
    - Non-secretariat users who register can only submit resources for approval, not publish directly to the site, unless their permissions are changed.
    - Email notification to moderators/staff when new resources are submitted
4. Editable user profiles
5. Permissions Groups for contributors, moderators, secretariat staff
6. Default resource form fields
    - files
    - images
7. Resource publication moderation
8. Search
9. Currently selected tag should be highlighted in Browse Tags menu
10. Set up authentication on existing user database backed
11. Implement Internal/External Projects Database with Google map or point to existing Typo3 implementation
