Hacking django-coltrane to create a generic resources website CMS for my place of work.

Todo
---

1. Rename 'Coltrane' to 'Phytosanitary'
1. Rename 'Entry' to 'Resource'
1. Add relevant fields to 'Resource' and migrate
    - files
    - images
    - modified_date
    - etc
1. User Registration (done?)
    - Non-secretariat users who register can only submit resources for approval, not publish directly to the site, unless their permissions are changed.
    - Email notification to moderators/staff when new resources are submitted
1. Editable user profiles for all user types
1. Permissions groups for contributors, moderators, staff
1. Resource publication moderation
1. Implement search of title, body and tag fields at least
1. Currently selected tag and categories should be highlighted in tag and category menus
1. Set up authentication on existing user database backend
1. Implement Internal/External Projects Database with Google map or point to existing Typo3 implementation
1. Implement Markdown preview with WMD
1. Write deployment documentation
